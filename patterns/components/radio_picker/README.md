## Radio Picker

The Radio Picker is a concept we pioneered on the NZTA website. It's very useful
for providing a touch-friendly grid of choices. This is often used in a
`ChoiceField` where it's important to _see_ all the available options at once.

For instance, you might wish to compare between the `free`, `paid` and `premium`
options of a plan, or pick the licence period for your vehicle. In these
situations, a `<select>` would be inappropriate, because it only one value is
visible at a time.
