## Buttons

A button is either a `<button>`, `<span>` or `<a>` tag which accepts user interaction.
If a component doesn't have an `href`, it's best to use a `<button>` element, as these
retain focus when the user tabs through the page.

*Note*: If using a `<span>` for your button, you will need to set a tab index or emulate
the tab interface via JS.

You probably won't use this component directly, as it's a pretty simple abstraction.
