## Accessible dropdown

The accessible dropdown is a progressively enhanced `<select>` widget, that
styles the currently selected value of the form element.

If JS is disabled, a standard `<select>` is rendered.

In general, this should be the only styling that's needed for a `<select>` in
your application. Styling the dropdown list itself introduces a number of
edge-cases and usability issues that are often not immediately apparent.
